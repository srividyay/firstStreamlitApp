## The Challenge: Advancing Diabetes Care Excellence

As the industry leader, we're not competing with others - we're setting the standard. Our challenge is to push the boundaries of what's possible in diabetes care and maintain our position as the premier solution.

### Current Healthcare Landscape
- **30-day readmission rate:** 22% for diabetic patients
- **Average cost per readmission:** $15,000
- **Medication non-adherence:** 40% of patients
- **Preventable complications:** 35% of hospital admissions
- **Diabetic retinopathy:** Leading cause of blindness in working-age adults
- **Annual eye exam compliance:** Only 55% of diabetic patients

### Our Pain Points

1. **Readmission Prediction**
   - Current model accuracy: 68% (unacceptable for clinical use)
   - Clinicians don't trust our risk scores
   - Missing early intervention opportunities

2. **Medication Optimization**
   - Trial-and-error prescribing leads to poor outcomes
   - Drug interaction risks not well understood
   - Patient response to medications highly variable

3. **Resource Allocation**
   - ICU beds utilized inefficiently
   - Specialist consultations not prioritized effectively
   - Length of stay 2.3 days longer than necessary

4. **Clinical Decision Support**
   - Alert fatigue from too many false positives
   - Lack of personalized treatment recommendations
   - No real-time risk stratification

5. **Diabetic Complications Screening**
   - 40% of diabetic patients develop retinopathy
   - Manual screening is time-consuming and error-prone
   - Shortage of ophthalmologists (6-month wait times)
   - Late detection leads to irreversible vision loss

- HIPAA-compliant deployment
- Clinical validation and safety protocols

### Phase 1: Data Foundation & Insights (Week 1)

1. **Comprehensive Data Audit**

1. **30-Day Readmission Risk Model**
   - Binary classification for readmission prediction
   - Must be explainable for clinical adoption
   - **Minimum Benchmark:** >75% AUC-ROC
   - **Stretch Goal:** >85% AUC-ROC
   - **Also valued:** Fairness across demographics, early warning capability

2. **Diabetic Retinopathy Detection (CNN)**

#### **Your 4th Model - The Clinical Innovation:**

**This is your chance to show deep clinical understanding.**

As you explore our data, you'll discover patterns that could save lives. Previous consulting teams have built models that predicted ICU transfers 12 hours early, identified patients who would respond better to alternative medications, discovered hidden diabetes subtypes that required different treatment approaches.

**What clinical insights will you uncover that our doctors haven't seen?**

Your 4th model should:
- Address a genuine clinical need you identify
- Improve patient outcomes or operational efficiency
- Show understanding of healthcare workflows
- Be something that excites our clinical staff

**We want you to surprise us.** The winning team won't just build what we asked for - they'll identify problems we didn't know we could solve. Look for patterns in length of stay, resource utilization, patient subgroups, complication risks, or anything else that could transform how we deliver care.

**Remember: In healthcare, the best model is the one that gets used by clinicians and improves patient lives.**

**Integrated Web Application Requirements:**
- Clean, intuitive interface for clinical users
- All 4 models accessible from single dashboard
- Patient risk scores and recommendations
- Retinopathy screening upload and results

## Data Quality & Integration Notes

**Real-World Data Challenges:**
- Patient identifiers may need alignment between datasets (patient_nbr vs Patient ID)
- Missing values marked as '?' (common in emergency admissions)
- Retinal image labels provided in separate file (retinal_labels.csv)
- ICD-9 diagnostic codes (older standard but valuable for teaching)

**This messiness is intentional** - real healthcare data is never perfect. Your ability to handle these challenges is part of the evaluation.

## 📅 Next Meeting & Week 1 Expectations

### **Second Meeting: August 21, 2025**
**Time:** 10:00 AM - 11:30 AM  
**Topic:** Clinical Progress Review & Guidance Session  
**Attendees:** Clinical leads and technical teams  

**This is a working session, not a formal review.**

**Professional Communication Expectations:**
As our potential AI partner, we expect consultant-level professionalism:
- **Never criticize our data quality** - we work with real-world clinical data
- **Frame challenges as opportunities** for innovation and value creation
- **Speak like a partner, not a vendor** - you're helping us transform healthcare
- **Remember:** Every "messy" data point represents a real patient's journey

**Come ready to discuss:**
- Clinical patterns you've identified in the data
- Questions about medical terminology or workflows
- Validation approaches you're considering
- Safety concerns or ethical considerations
- **Opportunities you've discovered** in the data complexity
- Early findings or preliminary results (if any)

**Language We Expect:**
- ✅ "We've identified an opportunity to handle emergency admission patterns"
- ✅ "The variation in data completeness could help us build more robust models"
- ✅ "We can leverage the missing weight data as a predictor of admission urgency"
- ❌ "Your data is messy/terrible/incomplete"
- ❌ "This data quality makes our job harder"
- ❌ "We need to fix your data problems"

**Our clinical team will provide:**
- Context for confusing medical data
- Clarification on clinical priorities
- Guidance on physician adoption factors
- Feedback on your clinical assumptions
- Access to subject matter experts

**Goal:** Make sure you understand the clinical context and aren't building models in a medical vacuum. Many technical teams fail because they don't understand healthcare workflows.

### **Specialized Sessions Next Week**

We'll arrange focused meetings between your team leads and our experts:
- **Data Engineering:** Meet with our Clinical Data Architect
- **ML/AI:** Meet with our Chief AI Officer
- **Web Development:** Meet with our VP Clinical Systems
- **Deployment:** Meet with our VP Clinical Operations  
- **Business Strategy:** Meet with our Chief Medical Officer

*Calendar invites will be sent following this meeting.*

### **Clinical Support & Resources**

To ensure HIPAA compliance and clinical validity:
- Access to our secure development environment
- Clinical terminology and guidelines
- Physician advisors for consultation
- Regulatory compliance documentation

*Detailed technical and clinical resources will be discussed in breakout sessions.*

### **Week 1 Progress Expectations**

**By the second meeting, you should:**
- Have explored the patient data thoroughly
- Understand basic clinical workflows
- Have identified potential risk factors
- Started building at least one model
- Have questions about clinical validity
- Identified your 4th model opportunity

**Common Week 1 Questions We Can Help With:**
- "What does this medical term mean?"
- "Why do some patients have missing data?"
- "Which outcomes matter most to physicians?"
- "How do doctors currently make these decisions?"
- "What would make a model trustworthy to clinicians?"

**What we DON'T expect yet:**
- Polished models or perfect accuracy
- Final architecture decisions
- Complete clinical validation plans

**Remember:** You're auditioning to be the industry leader's AI partner. Teams that complain about data quality don't win $15M contracts. Teams that find opportunities in complexity do.

**Critical Mindset:** Think like a clinician, not just an engineer. The best solutions come from teams who truly understand the patient journey and clinical decision-making process.

**Note:** Use this meeting to ensure you're building something physicians will actually use, not just something technically impressive.

### **Clinical Office Hours & Support**

**Support Available:**
- Daily clinical office hours: 3:00-4:00 PM EST
- 24/7 Slack channel with clinical team
- Physician advisor consultations by appointment

**You can pivot your 4th model choice until Week 3** - clinical insights often emerge later in the analysis.

**Note:** Peer evaluations within your team will influence individual grades. Healthcare requires true collaboration.
